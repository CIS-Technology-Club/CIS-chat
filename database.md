# Cebu International School - Early Years Program

This page details the Early Years program at Cebu International School (CIS), a preschool program for 3 and 4-year-olds.

**Program Overview:**

CIS offers early childhood education for children aged 3 and 4 years old. These programs are called Early Years 2 and Early Years 3 respectively. The school adapts the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) framework to create its early childhood education curriculum.  The PYP acknowledges the significance of experiences during the early years in laying the foundation for all future learning, and recognizes the rapid developmental rate in physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and aesthetic domains during this period.  The school aims to make the transition from home to a group setting as smooth as possible by building secure and trusting relationships between children and both new adults and peers.


**Program Philosophy and Approach:**

CIS's Early Years program emphasizes learning through play.  Teachers structure the classroom to stimulate children's natural curiosity and engage them in inquiry-based learning.  The program aims to build students' self-esteem and confidence. Teachers respond to spontaneous events and support skill development across all cognitive areas.

Specific pedagogical approaches include:

*   **Circle Time:**  Focuses on the big ideas within the units of inquiry, helping students make sense of the world around them.
*   **Active Project Participation:**  Students actively participate in evolving projects designed to reinforce the development of skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for success in life.
*   **Integrated Curriculum:**  Traditional disciplines such as mathematics, language learning, science, social studies, art, music, movement, and personal and social education are seamlessly integrated into activities throughout the day.

The curriculum follows the scope and sequence of the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) early years documents.  Learning is viewed as a developmental process, with clearly defined expectations and conceptual understandings developed at each stage.  Over a period of up to three years, students explore eight units of inquiry collaboratively developed by teachers. These units are globally relevant, engaging, and significant for the age group and students of all cultures.  For four to six weeks, students inquire into concepts such as family, self, expression through music and dramatic play, life cycles, the five senses, and community members.

# Cebu International School - Primary Years Programme (PYP)

This page provides an overview of the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) at Cebu International School (CIS), for students in Kindergarten through Grade 5.

**Program Background:**

CIS, founded in 1924, adopted the IB framework in 1997, becoming an IB Diploma Programme (DP) school in 1999 and adding the PYP in 2014.  This makes CIS the first and only IB World School in the Visayas region offering both the DP and PYP.

**PYP Philosophy:**

The PYP emphasizes inquiry-based learning, connecting new knowledge to existing knowledge. Teachers facilitate the process, allowing students to build meaning and refine understanding.  The program integrates the development of five key skill sets: social, thinking, research, self-management, and communication skills.  These skills are considered essential for lifelong learning.

**Transdisciplinary Approach:**

The PYP uses a transdisciplinary approach, teaching about globally significant issues through units of inquiry.  Kindergarten through Grade 5 have six units; Preschool has four. Each unit incorporates concepts, skills, attitudes, knowledge, and action within six transdisciplinary themes:

*   Who we are
*   Where we are in place and time
*   How we express ourselves
*   How the world works
*   How we organize ourselves
*   How we share the planet

CIS uses a whole-school approach to create a Program of Inquiry (POI) with logically sequenced units that build upon each other year by year. Units integrate science, social studies, and personal and social education.  The program aims to help students connect learning across disciplines and to life experiences.

**Core Subjects and Integration:**

The PYP includes core subjects: Math, English, Art, PE, and IT.  A world language (Mandarin or Spanish) is introduced in Grade 1.  The program integrates these subjects with units of inquiry whenever feasible.

**Personal and Social-Emotional Development:**

The PYP cultivates the IB learner profile:  inquirers, thinkers, communicators, risk-takers, knowledgeable, principled, caring, open-minded, balanced, and reflective.  Students also develop key attitudes: appreciation, commitment, confidence, cooperation, creativity, curiosity, empathy, enthusiasm, independence, integrity, respect, and tolerance.

**Assessment and Reporting:**

The school uses a range of assessment methods to track student progress. Regular verbal and written reports are provided.  Annual student-led conferences allow students to showcase their accomplishments and future goals.

**Parent Support:**

Parents are encouraged to support their children's learning by:

*   Assisting with self-management skills (homework).
*   Inquiring about their child's learning and sharing their own knowledge.
*   Supporting classroom learning through family activities.
*   Reflecting on their child's portfolio together.

**Further Information:**

More information on the IB and PYP can be found at [http://www.ibo.org/programmes/](http://www.ibo.org/programmes/).  Parents can also contact the PYP Coordinator or their child's teacher for further details, attend IB information meetings, or review information sent by the principal's office and classroom teachers.

# Cebu International School - Primary Years Programme (PYP) Curriculum

This page outlines the curriculum for the Primary Years Programme (PYP) at Cebu International School (CIS), covering Early Years through Grade 5.

**PYP Classes (Early Years - Grade 5):**

The class teacher collaborates with specialist teachers and administrators to develop and deliver thematic units.  These units integrate skills and content from various subjects: Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, Arts, World Languages, and Personal and Social Education (PSE).

**Key Curriculum Descriptors:**

The following sections detail the curriculum for each subject area:


**1. Core Subjects:**

*   **English:** The English curriculum focuses on developing key competencies (visual language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking) in diverse contexts.  Language acts as the connecting element across the curriculum.  Instruction uses the context of units of inquiry, aiming to make students effective communicators who employ critical thinking. The Common Core Standards guide instruction.

*   **Mathematics:**  The mathematics curriculum uses the PYP model, emphasizing conceptual understanding, skill proficiencies, and thinking skills.  Mathematics is taught within relevant contexts whenever possible, with connections made to other subject areas. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) standards guide instruction.

*   **Science:** The science curriculum aims to develop scientifically literate, caring, and responsible individuals who think critically and creatively. It fosters curiosity and understanding of the world, promoting a sense of responsibility towards the environment.  The curriculum is concept-driven, organized into four strands: scientific inquiry, life processes and living organisms, materials and their properties, and physical processes.

*   **Social Studies:** The social studies curriculum prepares students for global citizenship, fostering understanding of themselves, others, and their place in society.  It explores human behavior and activity objectively and sensitively.  The curriculum is organized into five standards: Time, Place, and Space; Change; Systems; and Global Awareness.

*   **IT (Information Technology):**  IT is integrated across all subject areas as a teaching and learning tool. The IT curriculum focuses on developing technological skills necessary for the 21st century.


*   **Personal and Social Education (PSE):** PSE focuses on student well-being, encompassing physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual, and social development.  It aims to develop self-understanding, positive relationships, and healthy lifestyles. Three key strands define this development: identity, active living, and interactions.



**2. Specials:**

*   **English as an Additional Language (EAL):** This program supports English language learners, differentiating instruction to ensure they achieve the same learning outcomes as mainstream students.  Instruction may be delivered through "push-in" (partial immersion) or "pull-out" (stand-alone) methods.

*   **World Language:** Students choose between Spanish and Mandarin.  The goal is to develop competence in a language other than English or their first language, promoting multilingualism and cultural awareness.

*   **Visual Arts:** The visual arts program emphasizes the importance of art as a form of communication and cultural expression. It aims to develop a broad range of artistic skills and appreciation for diverse art forms.

*   **Physical Education (PE):** PE focuses on learning through physical activity, developing skills, positive attitudes, and values related to movement, games, and healthy lifestyles.

*   **Music:** The music program views music as a fundamental form of human expression and communication, promoting appreciation for diverse musical styles and encouraging active participation in musical experiences.  General music is offered for grades K-5, and band for grades 4 and 5.


**3. Action and Service Learning:**

The PYP emphasizes extending learning beyond the intellectual to include socially responsible attitudes and actions.  Students are encouraged to take action based on their learning and reflect on the impact of their actions. Examples of student actions include fundraising, community projects, and environmental initiatives.

# Cebu International School - Primary Years Programme Communication and Reporting

This page details the communication and reporting methods used in the Primary Years Programme (PYP) at Cebu International School (CIS), Kindergarten through Grade 5.

**Communication Methods:**

*   **Assemblies:**  The school holds weekly assemblies on Mondays (whole school) and Fridays (Primary/Elementary School).  Classes present their learning, and school announcements are made. Parents are welcome to attend.

*   **Newsletter:**  Regular newsletters are sent home.  These newsletters from the homeroom teacher provide an overview of the unit of inquiry, highlight subject-specific content, list upcoming dates, and include talking points and a picture gallery for parents to share with their children.


*   **Approaches to Learning (ATL):**  The school emphasizes Approaches to Learning (ATL), which are skills and attitudes integrated across all subjects and grade levels.  Five ATL skill sets are identified: Social Skills, Communication Skills, Thinking Skills, Research Skills, and Self-Management Skills.  These skills are developed throughout the program and are reflected in the reporting system.  The acquisition of knowledge and skills is integrated within units of inquiry rather than being taught in isolation.

**Conferences:**

The school uses several types of conferences to facilitate communication:


*   **Goal Setting Conference:**  This initial conference involves students, parents, and teachers to collaboratively establish clear, measurable, and achievable goals for the year.  Goals are reviewed and adjusted regularly throughout the year based on student progress.

*   **Parent/Teacher Conference (PTC):**  PTCs are held at the end of the first trimester.  They provide a forum for direct communication between parents and teachers to share information, address concerns, and define roles in the learning process.

*   **Student-led Conferences (SLC):** These conferences involve the student and parents. The student leads the conference, sharing their learning process and demonstrating their understanding.  Multiple conferences may occur simultaneously.

*   **Student/Parent/Teacher Conference (SPTC):**  SPTCs occur at the end of the year. Students, parents, and teachers reflect on the year's learning, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.  New goals are set collaboratively, along with plans to support goal achievement.

*   **In-Class Presentations:** Parents are invited to attend classroom presentations, learning engagements, or unit exhibitions at least once per trimester.

*   **Individual Conferences:**  These conferences can be scheduled as needed at the request of students, parents, or teachers.


**Reporting:**

The reporting system aims to provide parents with clear and comprehensive information about their child's learning.  It combines grid criteria with descriptive statements and detailed narratives to describe student learning throughout the year. Reports inform conversations during conferences.

**Report Card Schedule:**

*   **November:** Trimester 1 Report; Optional PTC/SPTC
*   **March:** Trimester 2 Report
*   **June:** Trimester 3 Report
*   **September:** Student-led Conferences and Goal Setting
*   **February:** Optional PTC/SPTC (depending on the age of the student)
*   **May:** Student/Parent/Teacher Conference (SPTC)

# Cebu International School - Diploma Programme Curriculum

This page outlines the curriculum for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (DP) at Cebu International School (CIS), for Grades 11 and 12.

**Course Selection:**

IB Diploma Programme students take six courses, a mix of Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL). The selection ensures breadth of study across different subject groups:

*   Group 1: Studies in Language and Literature (English offered at CIS)
*   Group 2: Language Acquisition (Mandarin and Spanish offered at CIS)
*   Group 3: Individuals and Societies (Psychology and Business Management offered at CIS)
*   Group 4: Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics offered at CIS)
*   Group 5: Mathematics (Mathematics offered at CIS)
*   Group 6: Arts (Arts subjects offered at CIS)  or another subject from Groups 1-5.

Students take at least three, but no more than four, subjects at the Higher Level (HL), which have a recommended 240 teaching hours.  Remaining subjects are at the Standard Level (SL) with 150 teaching hours.  Subjects can be studied and examined in English, French, or Spanish.


**IB Learner Profile and Core Requirements:**

The DP curriculum fosters the IB learner profile: inquirers, thinkers, communicators, risk-takers, knowledgeable, principled, open-minded, caring, balanced, and reflective.  The program also includes three core requirements:

*   **Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS):**  Students engage in activities outside the classroom, potentially combining creativity, action, and service components.

*   **Theory of Knowledge (TOK):**  This course encourages critical reflection on the nature of knowledge, examining different ways of knowing and kinds of knowledge.

*   **Extended Essay:** Students conduct independent in-depth research on a topic related to one of their chosen subjects.


**Assessment:**

Assessment for the DP includes:

*   Written examinations at the end of the program, marked by external IB examiners.
*   Internal assessments completed in the school, either marked by teachers and then moderated externally or sent directly to external examiners.

Each course receives a score from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest).  Students can earn up to three additional points based on their combined TOK and Extended Essay scores.  A diploma is awarded to students achieving at least 24 points, with minimum performance levels across the program and satisfactory CAS participation. The maximum total score is 45.  The assessment is criterion-related, comparing student performance to pre-defined criteria rather than to other students' performance.

Students may opt for individual subject certificates instead of the full diploma if needed.

# Cebu International School - Student Support

This page describes the student support services offered at Cebu International School (CIS).

**Identifying Students with Learning Needs:**

CIS recognizes that a significant number of students may require additional learning support at some point during their schooling. The school uses a tiered approach to identify and address these needs, recognizing that learning needs can exist at both ends of the spectrum:  students who are less able and those who exceed expectations (gifted and talented).

The primary criterion for intervention is whether a student's progress is inadequate.  The school does not assume that all students will progress at the same rate.  If a teacher has concerns, they complete a student referral form, which is reviewed by the Learning Needs Coordinator.  Data from the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments are also considered. Students scoring in the bottom 20th percentile or identified as one year behind their age group, and those in the top 5th percentile or two years ahead of their age group, are flagged for further review.  Additional evidence is gathered, and support strategies are implemented to better understand the learning gap. If the MAP data doesn't accurately reflect classroom performance, the student is not considered "flagged under consideration."


**Student Support Tiers:**

Students requiring support are classified into tiers based on their needs:

*   **Tier 1:** Students remain in the regular classroom with peers but receive modifications to curriculum content and/or instructional practices from a Learning Needs teacher. Elementary students receive support for two sessions within the four-day timetable. Middle/High school students receive support for one subject every four days.

*   **Tier 2:** Students receive explicit instruction in social skills and significant modifications to curriculum content and instructional practices under the direction of a Learning Support teacher.  This could include support for external assessment requirements or direct skills sessions. Elementary students receive support for four sessions each day of the four-day cycle. Middle/High school students receive support for two subjects or two sessions per day.

*   **Tier 3:** Students receive one-on-one support from a Learning Needs Assistant.  The assistant is hired through CIS recruitment, and their salary is covered by the parents.


**Learning Needs Support Team:**

The student support services are provided by a team that includes:

*   Learning Needs Coordinator
*   Learning Needs Teacher
*   Learning Needs Support
*   Learning Needs Assistant

# Cebu International School - English as an Additional Language (EAL) Program

This page describes the English as an Additional Language (EAL) program at Cebu International School (CIS).

**Program Overview:**

CIS welcomes students of various nationalities, many of whom are multilingual or come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The EAL program provides support for students whose English language skills are not yet sufficient for full participation in the regular curriculum. Students are assessed during the admissions process and placed into one of three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced, ensuring appropriate support throughout their language acquisition journey.

The program's approach recognizes that while EAL learners share some characteristics with native English speakers, their distinct need to learn in and through another language, combined with differing cultural backgrounds and educational expectations, requires specialized support.  This support may include partial immersion ("push-in") or standalone ("pull-out") instruction, depending on the needs of the student.



https://cis.edu.ph/student-support/counseling/

# Cebu International School - Counseling Services

This page describes the counseling services available at Cebu International School (CIS).

**Counseling Philosophy:**

The program supports the school's mission by fostering the holistic development of students, helping them reach their full potential.  The counseling department works collaboratively with other school stakeholders to achieve the following goals:

*   Promote academic achievement and personal/social well-being.

# Cebu International School - Student Leadership

This page details the student leadership structure and activities at Cebu International School (CIS).

**Student Council Structure and Elections:**

CIS promotes student leadership through a democratically elected Student Council.  At the start of the academic year, students elect representatives from their respective homeroom classes.

*   **Elementary Student Council:** This council consists of a maximum of twelve student representatives selected from Grades 2, 3, 4, and 5.  These representatives act as the voice of their peers, advocating for improvements and positive changes within the elementary school.  A key activity is the organization and execution of bi-weekly elementary assemblies.  Student council members participate in planning and running these assemblies, which include elements such as the Philippine National Anthem, presentations by the principal, student talent showcases, and initiatives to enhance the overall school environment and foster school spirit.

*   **Middle and High School Student Council:**  This council is composed of nine class representatives (elected by each homeroom class) and four house captains.  The president and vice-president of the council are elected by the entire middle and high school student body. The council operates under a framework of five core purposes, summarized as "4S+F":  Social activities (planning and organizing social events for the student body), School Spirit (boosting school morale through inter-house competitions, spirit days, and pep rallies), School Improvements (identifying areas for improvement and submitting suggestions to the administration), Service (engaging in community service projects), and Fundraising (raising funds to support council activities and initiatives).


**Core Purposes of the Middle and High School Student Council (4S+F):**

A collapsible section on the page provides further detail on the five core purposes of the Middle and High School Student Council:

1.  **Social:**  Organizing after-school events such as trivia nights, game days, talent shows, and other activities open to the entire CIS community to foster social interaction and camaraderie.

2.  **Spirit:**  Enhancing school spirit and pride through activities like the triannual House Activity Days (HAD), where the student council is involved in all aspects of planning and execution; inter-house competitions; spirit days; and pep rallies.

3.  **School Improvement:**  Identifying areas needing improvement and submitting suggestions to the school administration.  A suggestion box is provided for students to offer feedback and ideas.

4.  **Service:**  Organizing and participating in service projects to benefit the CIS community and the wider community, including initiatives such as Teacher Appreciation Day and the annual Tree of Giving Christmas charity project.
